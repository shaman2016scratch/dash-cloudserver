    <h1>Dash cloud server documentation</h1>
    <p>Dashblocks has its own cloud server independent of TurboWarp or Scratch.</p>
    <p>Anyone can change their username, but a player with the nickname scratch_craft_2 probably won't.scratch_craft_2 is the other person who set this nickname.</p>
    <p>To reduce abuse, the usernames of the scratch team are blocked, as well as some nicknames that can be misleading, for example, the nickname 'Admin' can impersonate the user as the administrator of Dashblocks or the server without being one. The names of users that do not exist on Scratch are also blocked.</p>
    <p>Cloud variables can only store numbers.</p>
    <p>Cloud data is reset when the server is very busy or there is no one in the project for a specific time.</p>
    <p>Cloud variables are disabled when opening the editor.</p>
    <p>Don't abuse them to create unmodeled chats or as an alternative to storing data, hosting and databases exist for this.</p>
    <p>There are no logs that store changes to cloud variables.</p>
    <p>When using cloud data and extensions to interact with video, cloud variables are disabled for security reasons.</p>
    <h2>What should I do if I encounter a username that can be misleading (for example, impersonate the scratch or Dashblocks team)?</h2>
    <p>It is best to write to the <a href="t.me/Dashblocksforum">Dashblocks forum in a telegram.</a></p>
    <h2>What are the limits of this cloud server?</h2>
    <p>One cloud variable is up to 110000 characters.</p>
